# rosdocked

Originally forked from [here](https://github.com/jbohren/rosdocked), this fork
is specifically designed for running UTIAS mobile manipulator code.

Run Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo with a shared username, home directory, and
X11 graphics on a computer with a different Ubuntu version. Requires
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/):
```
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

Note that any changes made outside of your home directory from within the
Docker environment will not persist. If you want to add additional binary
packages without having to reinstall them each time, add them to the Dockerfile
and rebuild.

## NVIDIA

If your laptop has an NVIDIA graphics card, you'll need to use the `nvidia`
branch. That branch includes NVIDIA support by leveraging [this
Dockerfile](https://hub.docker.com/r/lindwaltz/ros-indigo-desktop-full-nvidia/).
This used to require installing a separate package `nvidia-docker2`, but Docker
now supports NVIDIA natively since version 19.03.

## macOS
It is not immediately obvious how to get this working on a Mac. There are
definitely some differences from Linux, and [this post](http://qr.ae/TUTszl)
may provide a reasonable starting point.

## Usage
* The name of your image must be in a file called `image_name.txt`.
* `build-image.sh` builds the image named in `image_name.txt`, following the
  directions laid out in the `Dockerfile`. You need to run this to initially
  build the image and rebuild it if you make changes to the Dockerfile.
* `new-container.sh` creates a new container from the latest image and
  automatically attaches to it. The container shares your home directory.
* `restart-container.sh` restarts an existing container that has been stopped.
* `attach-to-container.sh` attaches to an already-running container.

## Useful Docker Commands
* `docker ps`: List running containers. If you see your container running here,
  you can attach to it.
* `docker ps -a`: List all containers (running and stopped).
* `docker images`: List docker images.
